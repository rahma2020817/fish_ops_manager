# FastAPI Project

This is a FastAPI project template to get you started with building APIs using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Next, create a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows, use:

    ```sh
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On macOS and Linux, use:

    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your environment variables. For example:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
```

These variables can be accessed in your FastAPI application using the `python-dotenv` package or `pydantic` settings.

### 5. Run the Application

Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application with the following command:

```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

- `app.main:app` refers to the `app` instance in the `main.py` file inside the `app` directory.
- The `--reload` flag makes the server restart automatically after code changes, which is useful during development.

## Project Structure

Here's a basic structure for your FastAPI project:

```
your-repo-name/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── ...
├── venv/
├── .env
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Example FastAPI Application

Here is a simple example of what your `app/main.py` might look like:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

## Additional Commands

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```sh
deactivate
```

### Upgrade pip

To upgrade pip, use the following command:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```



### Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t fastapi-nginx .
```

### Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 fastapi-nginx
```
